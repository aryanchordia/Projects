This project is based on the sport of cricket. Essentially there will be a ball bowled to the player and based on the direction and speed of the ball the player must choose where to swing (left or right) and when to swing. If the player swings too early/late they will loose a wicket. Once the player makes contact with the ball the game switches to an aerial view of the pitch and the user can see how the ball is moving on the pitch. If the ball collides with a fielder then the ball is thrown back to the wickets and at this time the user can decide whether he wants to run or not. If he chooses to run and doesn't reach the other side of the pitch before the ball gets there he will loose a wicket (there are only 10 wickets per game.) If he does make it in time his runs will increase.

The aim is to beat the opponents score (shown on the top right hand corner) within the number of balls you have and without loosing all 10 wickets. If you do this you will win.
